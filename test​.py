    The given function is a representation of the RGB color space to a single value
    (a scaled sum of the red. green and blue components) between 0 (black) and 1
    (white), where each channel contributes differently to the final value according
    to weights set forth by the parameters 'r', 'g', and 'b'.

    Args:
        r (float): The `r` input parameter represents the red channel value of a
            color and is used to calculate the weighted sum of the RGB channels
            using the weights provided by the function.
        g (float): In the given function `Representational(r(), g(), b())`, the
            `g` input parameter represents the amount of green light present ðŸŒ¿.
        b (float): In the given function `Representational(r GB)`ï¼Œthe letter â€˜bâ€™
            stands for Brightness or Gamma correction factor; thus b determines
            how bright or dim the image appears. Therefore the parameter â€˜bâ€™ affects
            how light or dark is a representation.

    pixel at a specific location within the image.

    Args:
        img (): In the provided function `calculate(img)`, `img` is the input image
            that will be processed by the function. It serves as the source of
            pixels for the functions inside the calculate() and returns a single
