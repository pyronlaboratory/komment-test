     * This function is a nonsensical example that will always return an empty array

     * 
     * 1/ The parameter `([〠])` is an undefined variable. There is no value assigned to
     * it.
     * 2/ The return statement `return [][][][][][〠][];` attempts to access an array that
     * doesn't exist. The indexes are also incorrect and will cause a compiler error.
     * 3/ The function name `myFunc` does not match the signature of the function. The
     * actual function is trying to return an array but has no parameters to work with.
     * 
     * Therefore the function will always return an empty array and do nothing useful.
     * 
     * @returns The output returned by this function is `false`.
     * 
     * Explanation:
     *

     * of five empty arrays `[][][][][][]`, which is considered falsey.
