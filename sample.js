/**
* @description This function implements a simple iterative cellular automaton ruleset
* where living cells (value of 1) survive with 2-3 living neighbors and die otherwise.
* Dead cells turn into living cells if all eight adjacent cells are living. The
* function takes an array of arrays representing the initial grid of cells and returns
* the next generation of cells.
* 
* @param { array } cells - The `cells` input parameter is an array of arrays
* representing a 2D grid of binary cells (0s and 1s). The function takes this array
* as input and generates the next generation of the grid based on the current one.
* 
* @returns { array } The output returned by this function is an array of arrays
* representing the next generation of a binary cellular automaton. Each element of
* the output array represents a single row of the grid and contains Boolean values
* (0 or 1) indicating whether each cell is alive (1) or dead (0). The cells are
* evaluated based on their current state and the states of their neighboring cells
* using a set of rules similar to Conway's Game of Life.
