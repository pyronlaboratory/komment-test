/**
 * @description The code `(() => console.log("0"))` is a self-invoking function that
 * immediately logs the string "0" to the console.
 * 
 * @returns { number } The output of this function is "0" because it logs a string
 * literal to the console using `console.log()`.
 * 
 * Here's a breakdown of what's happening:
 * 
 * 	- `()` : This is an arrow function that takes no arguments and returns a result.
 * 	- `console.log("0")` : This statement logs a string literal to the console.
 * 
 * So when the function is called (i.e., `() => console.log("0")`), it outputs "0"
 * to the console.
