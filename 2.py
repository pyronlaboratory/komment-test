def server(port):




  """
  This function implements a TCP server that listens on a specified port (provided
  as an argument) and prints a message indicating that the server is active and
  ready to accept incoming connections. The function also includes a mention of
  "parallel" and "output channel mode changed," suggesting that it may be capable
  of handling multiple requests simultaneously and potentially operating with some
  form of non-blocking input/output mode.

  Args:
      port (int): The `port` input parameter specifies the port number that the
          server should listen on.
