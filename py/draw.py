def handleGlobalQuery(self, query):
  """
  This function processes a global query and returns a list of RankItems for color
  hex codes found at the beginning of the query string. It first checks if the
  query is empty or starts with a hash symbol # and strips the hash if it does.
  It then checks if the remaining string is of one of the allowed lengths (3-12)
  and consists only of hexadecimal characters before adding a RankItem to the list
  and returning it.

  Args:
      query (dict): The input parameter `query` is the global query made by the
          user on the application's search bar. It takes a string representation
          of the user's search query and filters the items to return based on that
          query.

  Returns:
      list: The function "handleGlobalQuery" returns a list of one "RankItem"
      containing an item with ID=md_id and text and subtext of "#code color
      description", and icon URLs beginning with "gen:?background=#".
