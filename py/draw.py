def handleGlobalQuery(self, query):
  """
  This function takes a query as an argument and returns a list of "RankItem"
  objects. It extracts the hex code from the query string if it starts with "#"
  and is of length 3/6/8/9/12 (those are hex digit lengths) and then uses that hex
  code to construct an icon URL to display the color. If the query has a valid hex
  code and matches a known hex color value from gen:?background=#, the function
  adds an item with text containing the original query text plus subtext describing
  the result obtained by substituting ?background=# and returns the list of items.

  Args:
      query (str): The input parameter 'query' is a string that contains the text
          search query entered by the user. It passes through various filtering
          methods before being compared to determine relevance and returns the
          matching rank list as desired results for the global query section of
          the code snipped shared

  Returns:
      list: The function returns a list containing one item.
