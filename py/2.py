def server(port):

  """
  The given code defines a function named `server` that listens for incoming
  requests on a given port and prints a message indicating that the server is
  listening and ready to receive new changes while also accepting changes made
  parallel to the output channel mode being changed.

  Args:
      port (int): The port parameter is passed as an argument to the server()
          function and sets the port at which the Python script listens for incoming
          requests and accepts new connections from clients wishing to send/receive
          messages over a TCP network socket using this custom designed web
          framework; thus enabling others if desired--i:e adding extra servers
          --by sending specified changes through dedicated pipes which make up
          what we referto today commonly called multithreading mode.
          
          In simpler words: the function 'server' takes the parameter 'port', and
          this 'port' dictates which port number on which this python server listens
          for incoming requests from external clients over a TCP connection (a la
          "network socket"). The output produced then prints "Server listening",
          including indicating its newly specified active port while operating
          within multithreading mode via extra worker processes capableof parallel
          adding of fresh modifications to further boost performance & scalability
          needs
