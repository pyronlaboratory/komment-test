def server(port):
  """
  This Python function `server` takes an argument `port`, and it prints a message
  indicating that the server is now listening on that port. The message includes
  a phrase about parallel updates while the output channel's mode has changed. In
  other words - a simple server constructor.

  Args:
      port (int): The `port` parameter tells the function on which port the server
          should be listening.
