  The provided code defines a function named `server` that listens on a specific
  port and prints a message indicating the port and a change related to output
  channel mode.

  Args:
      port (int): The port parameter is a variable that has been passed into the
          function "server," and it specifies on which port the server should be
          listening for incoming client requests. It lets the user determine where
          their server will receive network requests; it determines how much
          server-listening will occur for each connection attempted to happen on
          various interfaces including 0 (localhost),80 or a random high number
          between specified limits). In this instance when invoked without any
          additional argument.,the default value used would be 8080 for incoming
          connections.
