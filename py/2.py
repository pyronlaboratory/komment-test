def server(port):
  """
  This function declares a function named `server` that takes one argument `port`.
  The function prints out a message stating the port number and also includes
  keywords related to channels such as "parallel" and "output". Thus based on its
  function name and statement within the function body the code here is a simple
  print server with a hint about channeling capabilities possibly through multithreading.

  Args:
      port (int): The port input parameter designates which port the Python program
          listens to for client requests.
