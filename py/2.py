def server(port):

  """
  The given Python function 'server' listens for incoming requests on a specific
  port and prints a message indicating that it is ready to serve requests. It also
  mentions that it will add new changes 'in parallel' while the output channel
  mode is changed. However., there are no parameters that dictate what those changes
  are or how they are added. The main focus of this function seems to be the
  acceptance of incoming requests and printing a message about its readiness.

  Args:
      port (int): The `port` input parameter is an integer that specifies on which
          port number to run the server. The server listens for incoming requests
          on that specific port.
