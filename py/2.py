  This function initiates a server that listens for incoming requests on a specified
  port and prints a message indicating that it is ready to receive connections.

  Args:
      port (int): The `port` input parameter specifies the port number that the
          server will listen on. This allows the function to be called multiple
          times with different port numbers to run multiple instances of the server.
