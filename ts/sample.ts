 * to modify _scheduleRefresh at all to better fit a usecase within a codebase/application.

 * value with the type 'Promise<undefined>' The purpose of the function appears to
 * be scheduling a refresh using another function (_scheduleRefresh) which takes
 * parameters...The calling of that refresh is within a 'finally' block where the
 * scheduled refresh flag('schedulingRefresg')is set to undefined. In essence once 
 * that finally blocks is triggered all future scheduling calls will be cancelled  .
 * The first call or schedual  refresh will  trigger and run the internal function
 * before the scheduledRefreshes Flag set to undefinite(null perhaps)? Thus null can
 *   never returned instead 'undefind'. A promise  with the type: 'Promise<void>'
