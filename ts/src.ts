 * @param { number } result - The `result` parameter is not used or referenced at all
 * throughout the provided `MathComponent` code. Therefore the 'result' is completely
 * uncalled and has zero purpose for these set of codes within `MathComponent`.
 * 
 * Since none of its defined methods actually call it nor use 'result'. Therefor its
 * completely optional function input which ultimately is described by developers as
 * "a dead function input variable".
 * 
 * In other words `result' simply do not matter here; since nothing ever uses the
 * value to produce or affect output/results presented on screen via list display
 * within 'Math Component'; therefore remove it altogether if unwanted as it does
 * zero good; otherwise preserve and leave unaltered because the code appears functioning
 * just fine regardless without this dead result parameter
 * 
 * @param { object } index - In the `MathComponent` React functional component presented
 * above with the given code snippet. The 'index' input or key parameter of the map
 * function for the array of calculations performs three primary purposes:
 * 
 * 1) Each 'index' unique key value is a key component attribute allowing for simple
 * and easy lookup within the states and its state data by its particular unique keys
 * mapped therein; thus facilitating this simple organization structure via components
 * to reference each respective calculated result.
 * 
 * 2) An object-oriented way of performing map array loops that maintain their order
 * or sequential structuring while accessing a vast amount of data through their
 * component mapping with organized labels of math function titles like 'add' etcetera
 * and can access or call by name as index references such components label objects.
 * For instance to sum a calculation directly as 'Add', then look-up via map/for
 * functions that utilize that corresponding key within the object of function component
 * mappings that represent such an action within 'index'-referenced and structured
 * storage that facilitates this easy access for rendering purposes or calculations.
 * 
 * 3) These mapped 'index' object keys as referenceable identifiers ensure organization
 * by specific calculation types of operations that maintain organized look/render
 * performance by the map/for loops which utilize direct indexed components that allow
 * simple efficient direct data lookup at run-time without needing search times
 * overhead to look for function results within other objects (i.e. class hierarchy),
 * but directly referencing such result labels for organized efficiency gains; making
 * it possible to utilize various math functional operations via objects referenced
 * or looked up under array components facilitating simple rendering by referencing
 * indexed results instead of class hierarchies/ search method calls needed otherwise
 * potentially creating overhead delays due look-ups  thus providing more direct
 * access speedups vs classical organization OOP approach typically used; this provides
 * both a speedup as well as ease use with concise functional descriptions provided
 * with mathematical functions such add sub etc allowing an end result set via display
 * rendered HTML labes versus potentially lengthier class component expressions
 * typically associated via typical  Class Oriented  Programming styles when structuring
 * data objects that perform array based map/for operations that need fast lookup
 * performance typically utilized; all within the React functional component MathComponent
 * presented for discussion and example implementation within this react program .
 * In a word then : these indexes act primarily both facilitate simple organizational
 * labels for easier referencing via map loop component keyed index look-ups and
 * enable direct quicker rendering performance from simplified  reference based
 * organizational approach typically absent without potentially incurring additional
 * lookup method costs traditionally associated

 * @description This function imports React and defines a component that displays a
 * list of mathematical operations and their results. The component uses variousMath
 * methods such as add subtract multiply divide modulus power round floor ceiling log
 * and sin to perform calculations with given inputs. The resultsof these calculaions
 * are then displayed as a list of HTML labels
 * 
 * @param { number } result - In the `sin` function provided at the bottom of the
 * code snippet presented here as Math Component of react functional component that
 * receives only a single argument parameter `a` and immediately return's the result
 * after performing some computation utilizing that sole parameter; therefore the
 * input `result` has no bearing nor function here because `result` is never called
 * nor directly referenced or passed within the Math.sin() code function which does
 * computations and sin returns values of Math operations directly and that value is
 * what we need if we are supposed to render or use the result;  otherwise since its
 * absence could render ' undefined '. In simpler words this ` result' parameter just
 * doesn't exist nor serves any useful purpose within the sin functions and therefore
 * does not contribute much of consequence for Math Component because these results
 * gets computed anyway irrespective of this uncalled input value; thus `result' is
 * unreferenced or a 'dead' function input variable
 * 
 * @param { object } index - The index is a parameter used as an argument within map
 * functions within array loops. The value of this function key maps uniquely to the
 * component to be displayed and allows for easy component lookup through an object
 * if that's how you choose to structure your state for each particular calculation
 * result
