{/**
 * @description This React functional component called 'MathComponent' displays two
 * mathematical expressions as simple text within list items using a nested map()
 * method that processes and labels the elements being rendered by iterating an array
 * containing only two string values computed using addition and sine trigonometric
 * operations respectively for display without actual effect because its 'result'
 * parameter never gets used to affect these computations; rather it merely functions
 * as a counter (or key) to distinguish among its render-returned li list items by
 * integer value and to index those very labels; results begin with two labels result
 * 1: x because the 'result' input takes each element index from that array of values;
 * these items then get displayed on screen once react finishes rendering this component
 * for display. React component display functionality does include proper key attribute
 * placement optimization to improve/enhance reordering operations of work being done
 * on screen if necessary.
 * 
 * @param { number } result - Based on the provided code snippet from the question -
 * the answer can be explained as follows:
 * 
 * The result input parameter is never used within its own containing functional
 * component named 'MathComponent'. As such it does not affect computation of sine
 * functions that would determine each indexed list item label's resulting value to
 * display. Thus the parameter result plays zero roles for computations or purposeful
 * function calls since all functional parameter inputs and other values that compute
 * these Math Component displayed items are resolved using parameters named add and
 * b orMath.sin() instead of the function parameter result.
 * 
 * @param { number } index - In this particular function provided at the end of that
 * lengthy text snippet `index` is merely a mapping index employed by React; its value
 * counts from 0 up to as many items as remain within an array called `results`. The
 * key attribute assigns such numbers with their proper label index and optimizes
 * render order operations for display elements.

 * simple text within list items labeled with integers counting from 1.
 * 
 * @param { number } result - The "result" parameter is simply being used as an index
 * to label each li item being rendered. The "index+1" formula creates a list with
 * numbers beginning at the number two because it's keying off the array indexes when
 * rendering the list items. Therefore there will be 2 listed (result 1: x), and 3
 * listed (result 2: y) etc. There is no actual functional purpose of result being
 * there aside from its use as an index; result was never even assigned a value so
 * it isn't even being utilized for any actual math operations and is only ever passed
 * to the mapped function with no effect.
 * 
 * @param { number } index - In the `map()` function provided as an argument to
 * React.js's `results.map()` method inside `MathComponent`, the value `index`
 * represents which `result` element is currently being processed. Index counts from
 * 0 through however many items are left within `results`. `key` attributes are
 * important because React Elements (Components/Functional Components alike) "assume"
 * keys can provide optimization capabilities for re-ordering work done on screen by
 * the renderer of a react app (as long as all child element arrays passed into other
 * Components have been accounted for via key assignment(s)).
