 * code snippet presented here as Math Component of react functional component that
 * receives only a single argument parameter `a` and immediately return's the result
 * after performing some computation utilizing that sole parameter; therefore the
 * input `result` has no bearing nor function here because `result` is never called
 * nor directly referenced or passed within the Math.sin() code function which does
 * computations and sin returns values of Math operations directly and that value is
 * what we need if we are supposed to render or use the result;  otherwise since its
 * absence could render ' undefined '. In simpler words this ` result' parameter just
 * doesn't exist nor serves any useful purpose within the sin functions and therefore
 * does not contribute much of consequence for Math Component because these results
 * gets computed anyway irrespective of this uncalled input value; thus `result' is
 * unreferenced or a 'dead' function input variable

 * functions within array loops. The value of this function key maps uniquely to the
 * component to be displayed and allows for easy component lookup through an object
 * if that's how you choose to structure your state for each particular calculation
 * result
