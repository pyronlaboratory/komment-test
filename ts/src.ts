{/**
 * @description This is a React functional component that returns a list of two
 * mathematical expressions using addition and single-precision trigonometric operation
 * sine and displays the results as simple text inside list items labeled with integers
 * counting from two. The component takes no actual input but returns a list of results
 * calculated and stored as strings within an array and passed to the map function
 * with no effect. It is called the MathComponent because it is composed of several
 * math expressions like add() function and sin(). The results are rendered inside a
 * div element using a header and ul element and mapped function
 * 
 * @param { number } result - The result param doesn't affect the functionality of
 * the function and its merely being used to label each list item and therefore does
 * not affect math operations done by function nor does the value provided to it ever
 * get assigned to so it isn't used at all. Therefore its effect is zero; It simply
 * provides labels for list items rendering them  starting from "Result 1: x" up
 * through however many are there but since no assignments to this input happen nothing
 * about this parameter gets accomplished except maybe giving the function and React
 * Element key information that it can provide optimizations when the renderer performs
 * ordering screen work but these aren't used because react will just default assign
 * it undefinesed; this key provides for more efficient display/optimization since
 * these display lists have a direct index value tied to what gets displayed versus
 * simply trying everything blindly on one list making the math componenets display
 * a more intelligent
 * 
 * @param { array } index - In the provided React functional component "MathComponent",
 * the index input parameter is used as a key attribute for each list item within the
 * ul component. The keys are generated based on the array of mathematical expressions
 * passed to the map function and are responsible for associating rendered list items
 * with their corresponding values during rendering optimizations facilitated by the
 * renderer of the react app. The keys have no effect on the actual computation or
 * result returned from each mapped expression; only serving re-ordering capabilities
 * via optimized display decisions made during screen presentation processes within
 * any given app runtime environment utilizing the appropriate renderer capabilities
 * enabled at development or deployment configuration settings determining appropriate
 * supported feature set environments at the discretion of implementers using established
 * best practices and recommended development guidelines. Therefore its actual
 * functionality inside MathComponent's mapped function passed to React.js has little
 * purpose since its value comes through unmodified every time just like when passing
 * other immutable parameter(s) not relied upon for calculations that do produce
 * alterations compared versus initial setup configurations before program execution
 * occurred afterward and thus its actual input should likely receive alternative
 * consideration or modifications designed toward enabling its functionality requirements
 * within components' boundaries set forth above .
