     * values to be searched for amicable pairs.

     * 1/ If the input parameters `from` and `to` are invalid (i.e., one or both are
     * negative), an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
     * 2/ The function initializes an empty `LinkedHashSet` called `result`.

     * each value `i` between `from` and `to`, the function checks if the pair (`i`,
     * `i+1`) is amicable (i.e., whether `i*j` is a perfect square). If it is amicable.
     * the pair is added to `result`.
     * 4/ The function returns `result`, which now contains all amicable pairs of integers
     * within the given range.
