 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former

 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 *

/**
 * @description The function takes two arguments: TLE (Two-Line Elements) and qth
 * (ground track point), and returns an array of passes consisting of information
 * such as the satellite name( satellite information will not be included when providing
 * a response here but is contained within the sats object)
 * Direction( E/W direction based on apex Azimuth)
 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth
 * orientation to cardinal directions)
 * Max Elevation
 * Start time
 * and Duration with regard to start of the pass.
 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 * 
 * Are there any requests you would like me to address or clarify for this function?
 * 
 * @param { string } TLE - TLE (Two Line Elements) is the input parameter that is
 * expected to be a spacecraft's ephemeris data organized as two line elements separated
 * by a newline character "\n", providing satellite position information at specified
 * times.
 * 
 * @param { object } qth - The `qth` input parameter specifies the observer location.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The output returned by the `getTransits()` function is an array
 * of passes with information about each satellite pass. Each pass includes satellite
 * details such as frequency and direction of movement. Additionally it also displays
 * the countdown timer until the pass starts; apex azimuth when satellite transits
 * through the horizon (indicating whether satellite is going West or East); start
 * time and end time for that particular pass with total duration.

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former

 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated

 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

/**
 * @description The function takes two arguments: TLE (Two-Line Elements) and qth
 * (ground track point), and returns an array of passes consisting of information
 * such as the satellite name( satellite information will not be included when providing
 * a response here but is contained within the sats object)
 * Direction( E/W direction based on apex Azimuth)
 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth
 * orientation to cardinal directions)
 * Max Elevation
 * Start time
 * and Duration with regard to start of the pass.
 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 * 
 * Are there any requests you would like me to address or clarify for this function?
 * 
 * @param { string } TLE - TLE (Two Line Elements) is the input parameter that is
 * expected to be a spacecraft's ephemeris data organized as two line elements separated
 * by a newline character "\n", providing satellite position information at specified
 * times.
 * 
 * @param { object } qth - The `qth` input parameter specifies the observer location.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The output returned by the `getTransits()` function is an array
 * of passes with information about each satellite pass. Each pass includes satellite
 * details such as frequency and direction of movement. Additionally it also displays
 * the countdown timer until the pass starts; apex azimuth when satellite transits
 * through the horizon (indicating whether satellite is going West or East); start
 * time and end time for that particular pass with total duration.

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper

 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated

 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

/**
 * @description The function takes two arguments: TLE (Two-Line Elements) and qth
 * (ground track point), and returns an array of passes consisting of information
 * such as the satellite name( satellite information will not be included when providing
 * a response here but is contained within the sats object)
 * Direction( E/W direction based on apex Azimuth)
 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth
 * orientation to cardinal directions)
 * Max Elevation
 * Start time
 * and Duration with regard to start of the pass.
 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 * 
 * Are there any requests you would like me to address or clarify for this function?
 * 
 * @param { string } TLE - TLE (Two Line Elements) is the input parameter that is
 * expected to be a spacecraft's ephemeris data organized as two line elements separated
 * by a newline character "\n", providing satellite position information at specified
 * times.
 * 
 * @param { object } qth - The `qth` input parameter specifies the observer location.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The output returned by the `getTransits()` function is an array
 * of passes with information about each satellite pass. Each pass includes satellite
 * details such as frequency and direction of movement. Additionally it also displays
 * the countdown timer until the pass starts; apex azimuth when satellite transits
 * through the horizon (indicating whether satellite is going West or East); start
 * time and end time for that particular pass with total duration.

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper

 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated

 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

/**
 * @description The function takes two arguments: TLE (Two-Line Elements) and qth
 * (ground track point), and returns an array of passes consisting of information
 * such as the satellite name( satellite information will not be included when providing
 * a response here but is contained within the sats object)
 * Direction( E/W direction based on apex Azimuth)
 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth
 * orientation to cardinal directions)
 * Max Elevation
 * Start time
 * and Duration with regard to start of the pass.
 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 * 
 * Are there any requests you would like me to address or clarify for this function?
 * 
 * @param { string } TLE - TLE (Two Line Elements) is the input parameter that is
 * expected to be a spacecraft's ephemeris data organized as two line elements separated
 * by a newline character "\n", providing satellite position information at specified
 * times.
 * 
 * @param { object } qth - The `qth` input parameter specifies the observer location.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The output returned by the `getTransits()` function is an array
 * of passes with information about each satellite pass. Each pass includes satellite
 * details such as frequency and direction of movement. Additionally it also displays
 * the countdown timer until the pass starts; apex azimuth when satellite transits
 * through the horizon (indicating whether satellite is going West or East); start
 * time and end time for that particular pass with total duration.

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper

 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated

 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

/**
 * @description The function takes two arguments: TLE (Two-Line Elements) and qth
 * (ground track point), and returns an array of passes consisting of information
 * such as the satellite name( satellite information will not be included when providing
 * a response here but is contained within the sats object)
 * Direction( E/W direction based on apex Azimuth)
 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth
 * orientation to cardinal directions)
 * Max Elevation
 * Start time
 * and Duration with regard to start of the pass.
 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 * 
 * Are there any requests you would like me to address or clarify for this function?
 * 
 * @param { string } TLE - TLE (Two Line Elements) is the input parameter that is
 * expected to be a spacecraft's ephemeris data organized as two line elements separated
 * by a newline character "\n", providing satellite position information at specified
 * times.
 * 
 * @param { object } qth - The `qth` input parameter specifies the observer location.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The output returned by the `getTransits()` function is an array
 * of passes with information about each satellite pass. Each pass includes satellite
 * details such as frequency and direction of movement. Additionally it also displays
 * the countdown timer until the pass starts; apex azimuth when satellite transits
 * through the horizon (indicating whether satellite is going West or East); start
 * time and end time for that particular pass with total duration.

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper

 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated

 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

/**
 * @description The function takes two arguments: TLE (Two-Line Elements) and qth
 * (ground track point), and returns an array of passes consisting of information
 * such as the satellite name( satellite information will not be included when providing
 * a response here but is contained within the sats object)
 * Direction( E/W direction based on apex Azimuth)
 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth
 * orientation to cardinal directions)
 * Max Elevation
 * Start time
 * and Duration with regard to start of the pass.
 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 * 
 * Are there any requests you would like me to address or clarify for this function?
 * 
 * @param { string } TLE - TLE (Two Line Elements) is the input parameter that is
 * expected to be a spacecraft's ephemeris data organized as two line elements separated
 * by a newline character "\n", providing satellite position information at specified
 * times.
 * 
 * @param { object } qth - The `qth` input parameter specifies the observer location.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The output returned by the `getTransits()` function is an array
 * of passes with information about each satellite pass. Each pass includes satellite
 * details such as frequency and direction of movement. Additionally it also displays
 * the countdown timer until the pass starts; apex azimuth when satellite transits
 * through the horizon (indicating whether satellite is going West or East); start
 * time and end time for that particular pass with total duration.

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper

 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated

 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

/**
 * @description The function takes two arguments: TLE (Two-Line Elements) and qth
 * (ground track point), and returns an array of passes consisting of information
 * such as the satellite name( satellite information will not be included when providing
 * a response here but is contained within the sats object)
 * Direction( E/W direction based on apex Azimuth)
 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth
 * orientation to cardinal directions)
 * Max Elevation
 * Start time
 * and Duration with regard to start of the pass.
 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 * 
 * Are there any requests you would like me to address or clarify for this function?
 * 
 * @param { string } TLE - TLE (Two Line Elements) is the input parameter that is
 * expected to be a spacecraft's ephemeris data organized as two line elements separated
 * by a newline character "\n", providing satellite position information at specified
 * times.
 * 
 * @param { object } qth - The `qth` input parameter specifies the observer location.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The output returned by the `getTransits()` function is an array
 * of passes with information about each satellite pass. Each pass includes satellite
 * details such as frequency and direction of movement. Additionally it also displays
 * the countdown timer until the pass starts; apex azimuth when satellite transits
 * through the horizon (indicating whether satellite is going West or East); start
 * time and end time for that particular pass with total duration.

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper

 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated

 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

/**
 * @description The function takes two arguments: TLE (Two-Line Elements) and qth
 * (ground track point), and returns an array of passes consisting of information
 * such as the satellite name( satellite information will not be included when providing
 * a response here but is contained within the sats object)
 * Direction( E/W direction based on apex Azimuth)
 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth
 * orientation to cardinal directions)
 * Max Elevation
 * Start time
 * and Duration with regard to start of the pass.
 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 * 
 * Are there any requests you would like me to address or clarify for this function?
 * 
 * @param { string } TLE - TLE (Two Line Elements) is the input parameter that is
 * expected to be a spacecraft's ephemeris data organized as two line elements separated
 * by a newline character "\n", providing satellite position information at specified
 * times.
 * 
 * @param { object } qth - The `qth` input parameter specifies the observer location.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The output returned by the `getTransits()` function is an array
 * of passes with information about each satellite pass. Each pass includes satellite
 * details such as frequency and direction of movement. Additionally it also displays
 * the countdown timer until the pass starts; apex azimuth when satellite transits
 * through the horizon (indicating whether satellite is going West or East); start
 * time and end time for that particular pass with total duration.

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper

 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated

 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

/**
 * @description The function takes two arguments: TLE (Two-Line Elements) and qth
 * (ground track point), and returns an array of passes consisting of information
 * such as the satellite name( satellite information will not be included when providing
 * a response here but is contained within the sats object)
 * Direction( E/W direction based on apex Azimuth)
 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth
 * orientation to cardinal directions)
 * Max Elevation
 * Start time
 * and Duration with regard to start of the pass.
 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 * 
 * Are there any requests you would like me to address or clarify for this function?
 * 
 * @param { string } TLE - TLE (Two Line Elements) is the input parameter that is
 * expected to be a spacecraft's ephemeris data organized as two line elements separated
 * by a newline character "\n", providing satellite position information at specified
 * times.
 * 
 * @param { object } qth - The `qth` input parameter specifies the observer location.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The output returned by the `getTransits()` function is an array
 * of passes with information about each satellite pass. Each pass includes satellite
 * details such as frequency and direction of movement. Additionally it also displays
 * the countdown timer until the pass starts; apex azimuth when satellite transits
 * through the horizon (indicating whether satellite is going West or East); start
 * time and end time for that particular pass with total duration.

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper

 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated

 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

/**
 * @description The function takes two arguments: TLE (Two-Line Elements) and qth
 * (ground track point), and returns an array of passes consisting of information
 * such as the satellite name( satellite information will not be included when providing
 * a response here but is contained within the sats object)
 * Direction( E/W direction based on apex Azimuth)
 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth
 * orientation to cardinal directions)
 * Max Elevation
 * Start time
 * and Duration with regard to start of the pass.
 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 * 
 * Are there any requests you would like me to address or clarify for this function?
 * 
 * @param { string } TLE - TLE (Two Line Elements) is the input parameter that is
 * expected to be a spacecraft's ephemeris data organized as two line elements separated
 * by a newline character "\n", providing satellite position information at specified
 * times.
 * 
 * @param { object } qth - The `qth` input parameter specifies the observer location.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The output returned by the `getTransits()` function is an array
 * of passes with information about each satellite pass. Each pass includes satellite
 * details such as frequency and direction of movement. Additionally it also displays
 * the countdown timer until the pass starts; apex azimuth when satellite transits
 * through the horizon (indicating whether satellite is going West or East); start
 * time and end time for that particular pass with total duration.

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper

 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated

 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

/**
 * @description The function takes two arguments: TLE (Two-Line Elements) and qth
 * (ground track point), and returns an array of passes consisting of information
 * such as the satellite name( satellite information will not be included when providing
 * a response here but is contained within the sats object)
 * Direction( E/W direction based on apex Azimuth)
 * Frequency( exact or to fixed four decimal places depending upon apexAzimuth
 * orientation to cardinal directions)
 * Max Elevation
 * Start time
 * and Duration with regard to start of the pass.
 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based
 * upon JSpredict capabilities utilized later within its methodology; these include
 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per
 * predicted pass (in milliseconds), the program simply adds that to total calculated
 * pass duration . Ultimately then returns all collected organized by Satellite names
 * 
 * Are there any requests you would like me to address or clarify for this function?
 * 
 * @param { string } TLE - TLE (Two Line Elements) is the input parameter that is
 * expected to be a spacecraft's ephemeris data organized as two line elements separated
 * by a newline character "\n", providing satellite position information at specified
 * times.
 * 
 * @param { object } qth - The `qth` input parameter specifies the observer location.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The output returned by the `getTransits()` function is an array
 * of passes with information about each satellite pass. Each pass includes satellite
 * details such as frequency and direction of movement. Additionally it also displays
 * the countdown timer until the pass starts; apex azimuth when satellite transits
 * through the horizon (indicating whether satellite is going West or East); start
 * time and end time for that particular pass with total duration.

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * the list TLELines composed by breaking the user provided string representation
 * consisting simply ONE \r\n between each line element pair , with a new line
 * representing Line elements . Next , we check whether current observed line elements
 * are null before we attempt  observe the next two adjacent lines which follow
 * suit(taking their place respectively at Index position : i+1) until another pass
 *   (subsequent line element) remains unobserved by being beyond minimum elevation
 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper
 * limit and continues loop iteration while either still remaining within the former
 * limits before concluding via array's size . Once having covered both successive
 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their
 * adjacent pairs- whose durations haven’t yet exceeded maximum allowed values per

 * The function begins by defining variables necessary for observations at qth based

 * required or else maximum duration  allowed per predicted passage passes the upper

 * lines if we remain left with leftover array positions containing incomplete observed
 * information - typically from the starting two original entries given without their

 * station's location qth and starts at startTime
 * 
 * @param { array } qth - Qth input parameters serves as a fixed observation point.
 * It consists of an array with two elements: latitute and longitude.
 * 
 * @param { number } startTime - The startTime parameter determines when each pass
 * ends and begins by telling the jspredict() which moment at which to begin observing
 * transits from the satellites over the QTH (Quality Tracking H Station). This
 * parameter sets the boundary for when an observational period will conclude for
 * each transit; passes will be filtered based on how much elevation the satellite
 * reached before being declared valid.
 * 
 * @returns { object } The function "determinePass" returns a list of passes or false
 * if no pass is found. The list contains objects with satellite name and maximum
 * elevation information. The object is ordered based on start time. If no pass is
 * found within the given start and end times (20 minutes), the function returns "false."
